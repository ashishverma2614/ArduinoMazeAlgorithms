  Unzip, navigate to file location and type 'make upload'.

Assumptions:
  Refereced libraries are present on the user's computer, user has a working Arduino Mega 2560.

Other Information:
  We have included previous .cpp files to document our progress. Additionally, a word file is included that goes into more detail about how each algorithm works and what it does.
